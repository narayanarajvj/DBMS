# Semi-automated self checkout system

## Project description
It is an application developed using Java Programming Language and MySQL for database connection which provides a mechanism for customers to process their own purchases from a retailer. It is an alternative to the traditional cashier-staffed checkout. The customers performs the job of the cashier themselves. The application generates a token and a payment is made against each token by the customer. The payment receipt is shown to the retailer. Upon confirming the payment, the retailer gives the product to the customer. A token is essentially used to keep track of each transaction.
